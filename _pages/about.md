Hao Ai (*艾浩, Conley*) is a first-year PhD candidate in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. I am honored to work with Prof. [Eyal Ofek](https://eyalofek.org/), Prof. [Jianbo Jiao](https://jianbojiao.com/) and Prof. [Ales Leonardis](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~leonarda/). I am focused on understanding the 3D world in accordance with physical laws and aim to apply visual algorithms to real-world scenarios and HCI applications such as VR/AR, gaming, and robotics. (*Prior to this, I had the pleasure of collaborating with Prof. Addison Lin Wang for two years, and I am grateful for his assistance.*)

I earned my B.Sc. from Beijing Jiaotong University, followed by collaboration with Prof. [Qingmin Liao](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lqm_en/main.htm) on my M.Sc. in Image Signal Processing at Tsinghua University.
You can find my CV here: [Hao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
